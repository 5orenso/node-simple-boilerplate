A small boilerplate to help you kickstart your projects with unit tests, integration tests, code coverage, continous integration, code hinting and code style enforcement.

Helper modules in use:

__JSHint__
A tool that helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code.

__Grunt__

__JSCS__
JSCS is a code style linter for programmatically enforcing your style guide.

__Istanbul__
A Javascript code coverage tool written in JS.

__Travis__
Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service. It is integrated with GitHub and offers first class support for many languages.

__Coveralls.io__
Coveralls is a web service to help you track your code coverage over time, and ensure that all your new code is fully covered.
